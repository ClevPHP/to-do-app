# ToDo App

## Instructions

Complete the ToDo App using either procedural style code or object oriented style code, or a combination of both as you deem appropriate.

## Getting Started

To get started, fork the project in GitHub and create a pull request when you are ready to submit your functional todo app.

A basic project structure is provided for you, with template examples, but feel free to build the app as you wish.

Remember: There is no right or wrong answer, only the code that you write and the code that never gets written.
