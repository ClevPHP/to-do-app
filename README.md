# ToDo App

## Instructions

Complete the ToDo App using either procedural style code or object oriented style code, or a combination of both as you deem appropriate.

## Getting Started

To get started, fork the project in GitHub.

A basic project structure is provided for you, with template examples, but feel free to build the app as you wish.

Remember: There is no right or wrong answer, only the code that you write and the code that never gets written.

When you are ready to submit your functional todo app, create a pull request on GitHub.

## Vagrant Setup

Included in the project is a vagrantfile for [scotchbox](http://box.scotch.io), a preconfigured Vagrant Box with a full array of LAMP Stack features to get you up and running with Vagrant in no time.

With Vagrant and VirtualBox installed, all you have to do is open the command line, change the directory to your local copy of the to-do-app, and run the command `vagrant up`.

## Database Access

At the top of `public/index.php` is some code to connect to the database (and is pre-configured to connect to the database setup by scotchbox.) If you are new to MySQLi or SQL in general, then take a look at ['MySQLi' for Beginners](http://codular.com/php-mysqli).
